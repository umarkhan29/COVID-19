'''
This code creates a CSV format of data set with resized images of your defined size (Height, Width)
We got labels for every image from metadata.csv and in new creted dataset, first attribute defines the label
label == 1 defines COVID-19 and Label == 0 defines all others
Since Excel contains XFD as last column and XFD equals 16384. Thus we have to look for the resized height and width
In this example we took 40 x 40 with 3 channels making total row size (40x40x3)+1 +1 is added because label is stored as first attribute of image
